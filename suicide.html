<h1>WHY DO PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE?</h1> 
    <p>Everyone has a reason why he or she has the desire to put an end to their lives.The most common of them are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people commit suicide because of some mental health disorders:
      <ul>
      <li>Depression</li>
      <li>Bipolar disorder</li>
    <li>Schitzophrenia</li>
          <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
          <li>Personality disorders</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To escape from the problems of life.</li>
    <li>Because they think everyone is better off without them.</li>
    <li>Because they fell that living is hopeless.</li>
    <li>Because they can't stand the pain they are going through.</li>
    <li>Because they feel that they are a burden to everyone.</li>
    <li>Because they feel alone.</li>
    <li>Because they feel unloved.</li>
    <li>Because they feel useless.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>I am sure most ofthem would say that their reasons are valid but <a href="Issuicide.html" style="font-size: 20">is suicide the answer?</a> </p
